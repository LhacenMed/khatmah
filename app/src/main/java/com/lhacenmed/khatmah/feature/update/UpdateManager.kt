/**
 * Launch-time coordinator that re-hydrates [UpdateRegistry] from what survived the last session, so
 * the update flow is consistent across cold starts and offline relaunches:
 *
 *  • A staged APK that is newer than the running build resumes straight to [UpdateState.Downloaded]
 *    (the install prompt) — and is reconstructed into an [AppUpdate] even if nothing else persisted,
 *    so the dialog always has something to show. An already-installed or stale APK is deleted.
 *  • A persisted "available" update re-surfaces the prompt even with no connectivity. It and the
 *    stored manifest are dropped once the running build has caught up (i.e. the update was applied).
 *
 * Called once per process from [com.lhacenmed.khatmah.core.App]; the online re-check that discovers
 * *new* updates lives in MainActivity, gated on connectivity.
