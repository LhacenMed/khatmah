/**
 * FrameLayout-based view flipper for panel navigation — replaces the previous ViewFlipper
 * subclass that was silently killing ripple animations.
 *
 * Root cause of the ripple bug:
 *   ViewFlipper.showOnly() is called inside both setDisplayedChild() and addView()
 *   (inherited from ViewAnimator). It calls setVisibility(GONE) on outgoing children,
 *   which synchronously triggers RippleDrawable.cancelExistingAnimations() — the ripple
 *   animation is destroyed before our visibility-restore line ever runs.
 *
 * Fix:
 *   Extend FrameLayout directly. FrameLayout never forces child visibility, so we own
 *   the lifecycle entirely and ripple animations complete naturally.
 *
 * displayedIndex tracks the active panel and mirrors two ViewAnimator behaviors that
 * must be replicated manually:
 *
 *   addView  — ViewAnimator increments mWhichChild when a view is inserted at or before
 *              it, so the tracked child doesn't silently shift. We do the same.
 *              Without this, backward navigation (which inserts the cached panel at
 *              index 0) causes displayedIndex to point at the wrong view, inverting the
 *              clip and scrim targets for the entire transition.
 *
 *   removeView — decrements displayedIndex when the removed view was before it,
 *                keeping the index valid after the outgoing panel is discarded.
 *
 * Not marked internal so that [com.example.filesai.ui.popupmenu.MenuFlipper] can extend
 * it without a visibility mismatch compile error.

     * shifts the current panel to index 1 while displayedIndex stays 0, causing
     * displayedChildView to return the newly inserted panel instead of the current one.
     * The result is that prevPanel and scrimTarget are set to the wrong views, and the
     * clip dimensions animate against the inverted pair.
     *
     * Negative index means "append at end" — never satisfies the condition.
     * The childCount > 1 guard skips the first-panel insertion (no shift needed).
