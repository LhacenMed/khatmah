/**
 * Like [ClipDrawable], but clips in terms of pixels instead of percentage — horizontally.
 *
 * Mirrors [HeightClipDrawable] for the horizontal axis, but with the opposite anchor:
 * the RIGHT edge is fixed while the LEFT edge moves inward as [clippedWidth] shrinks,
 * matching the popup's right-anchored alignment to its trigger button.
 *
 * Used by [MenuFlipper] to animate the popup's visible width without triggering layout
 * passes — only the background's bounds (and therefore its rendering outline) change.
 * Combined with [android.view.View.clipToOutline] = true on the flipper, this clips ALL
 * child rendering to the animated clip region with no view resizing needed.
 *
 * In the background chain, [WidthClipDrawable] is the outermost wrapper so its bounds
 * form the outline consumed by [android.view.View.clipToOutline], giving correct combined
 * width + height clipping when stacked with [HeightClipDrawable] as the inner layer.
